# 🎲 Dice Game - React + Vite

A fun and interactive Dice Game built using **React** and **Vite**. This project is part of my web development portfolio and showcases state management, conditional rendering, and basic game logic using React.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Select a number from 1 to 6.
2. Click on the dice to roll it.
3. If the rolled number matches your selected number:
   - You gain points equal to that number.
4. If it doesn't match:
   - You lose 2 points.
5. Use the **Reset Score** button to start over.
6. Click **Show Rules** to see the instructions again.

> ⚠️ If you click the dice without selecting a number, a red warning message will appear:  
> **"You have not selected any number."**
